h1. Redis.framework (for OS X 10.7)

h3. Objective-C Wrapper around "Hiredis":http://github.com/antirez/hiredis
h3. A fork of "ObjCHiredis":https://github.com/lp/ObjCHiredis

p. Creation of an autoreleased object is easy and comes in 3 flavours:

bc. Redis * r = [[Redis alloc] initWithHost:@"127.0.0.1" password:nil port:6379 db:0];
id result = [r command:@"KEYS *"];
id result = [r command:@"SET MYKEY MYVALUE"];
id result = [r commandArgv:[NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"SET", @"MYKEY", @"MYVALUE", nil]];

p. Pub/Sub implementation

bc. [redis command:@"SUBSCRIBE CHANNELZ"];
retVal = [redis getReply];
// Will block until it receives data from a a PUBLISH CHANNELZ.
